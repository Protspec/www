      <h1>A Security UX Studio</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Protspec</strong> helps cryptonatives interact with blockchain ecosystems safely
        through design, technology, and education.
      </p>

      <h2>Bulwark</h2>

      <p>
        Bulwark by Protspec is a browser extension that detects crypto scam
        websites. By combining code analysis with domain blocklists,
        Bulwark can differentiate legitimate websites from crypto scams and warn
        you when you are about to face danger.

      <h3>Why Bulwark?</h3>

      <p>
        Most wallets and security browser extensions rely on blocklists of
        existing malicious domains to protect their users. But this is a
        poor solution on its own, as these lists depend on manual processes for
        domains to be added to them. By the time this process has completed
        for a domain, thousands of dollars have likely flowed from victims'
        wallets, perhaps yours, to the scammer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bulwark uses open-source domain blocklists as just one method to
        protect cryptonatives. When blocklists fail, Bulwark will analyze your
        current website’s domain and code for patterns that match crypto
        scam websites. This pattern-matching is finely tuned so Bulwark can
        detect bespoke scam websites, not just those using a pre-existing kit.
      </p>
