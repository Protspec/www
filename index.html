      <p>
        Bulwark is a browser extension that detects crypto scam
        websites. With its novel phishing detection engine, Bulwark can scan the code – not just smart contracts – of any website you are visiting to look for signs of a crypto scam and warn you before you connect your wallet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bulwark’s edge is in its novel phishing detection engine, which you
        can run on any website you are visiting. The engine is finely tuned so Bulwark can
        detect bespoke scam websites, not just those using a pre-existing kit, and is less likely to flag legitimate websites as scams compared to other solutions that rely on community reporting or AI .

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <p>Protspec hunts for threats that use platforms like X and Farcaster to target cryptonatives. Specificaly Protspec alerts the public about threat actors tricking victims into downloading a type of malware called infostealers. The consequences for installing such malware can result in loss of crypto assets, account credentials, personally identifiable information and more.</p>

      <p>You can stay on-top of these threats by following d0wnlore’s pinned malware alert thread on X, which is reguarly updated as new infostealer threats are discovered.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Protspec is the Web3 security lab by d0wnlore, a founding member of
        <a href="https://www.bankless.community/">BanklessDAO</a>'s InfoSec Team and a former offensive security specialist in TradFi and tech.
        Outside of Protspec he helps other cryptonatives stay safe through his security education writing in
        <a href="https://indypen.xyz/the-ux-risks-of-gasless-transactions/">IndyPen CryptoMedia</a>, <a href="https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/web3-security">Bankless Academy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/d0wnlore/status/1745656474012172589">X</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a decade of exposure to blockchain ecosystems, starting with Bitcoin ATMs and in-person payments, d0wnlore has an understanding of the UX and security pain points that still persist. Frustrated by the industry's lack of effective answers to crypto scams, he started Protspec to make blockchain ecosystems safer and less intimidating for cryptonatives.
