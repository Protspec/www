      <p>
        Bulwark by Protspec is a browser extension that detects crypto scam
        websites. By combining code analysis with domain blocklists,
        Bulwark can differentiate legitimate websites from crypto scams and warn
        you when you are about to face danger.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Bulwark?</h3>

      <p>
        Most wallets and security browser extensions rely on blocklists of
        existing malicious domains to protect their users. But this is a
        poor solution on its own, as these lists depend on manual processes for
        domains to be added to them. By the time this process has completed
        for a domain, thousands of dollars have likely flowed from victims'
        wallets, perhaps yours, to the scammer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bulwark uses open-source domain blocklists as just one method to
        protect cryptonatives. When blocklists fail, Bulwark will analyze your
        current website’s domain and code for patterns that match crypto
        scam websites. This pattern-matching is finely tuned so Bulwark can
        detect bespoke scam websites, not just those using a pre-existing kit.

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Protspec is the security UX studio by d0wnlore, a founding member of
        BanklessDAO's InfoSec Team. Outside of Protspec he helps other
        cryptonatives stay safe through his security education writing in
        <a href="https://indypen.xyz/the-ux-risks-of-gasless-transactions/">IndyPen CryptoMedia</a>, <a href="https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/web3-security">Bankless Academy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/d0wnlore/status/1745656474012172589">X</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a decade of exposure to blockchain ecosystems, starting with Bitcoin ATMs and in-person payments, d0wnlore has an understanding of the UX and security pain points that still persist. Frustrated by the industry's lack of effective answers to crypto scams, he started Protspec to make blockchain ecosystems safer and less intimidating for cryptonatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        d0wnlore was previously a penetration tester in TradFi. Before that, he
        dual-wielded product design and front-end web development duties at
        various tech startups. He is likely the only OSCP-certified UX designer
        you will ever meet.
